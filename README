# Library API - Postman Collection

This project allows you to manage books and authors via an API. Below are the details on how to use the endpoints and Postman collection.

## Setting Up Dynamic URLs in Postman

### Step 1: Create Environments in Postman
- Create two environments: `Development` (for localhost) and `Production` (for the hosted Render URL).
  
### Step 2: Define Variables for Environment
- Add a variable `baseUrl` in each environment:
  - `Development`: `http://localhost:5000`
  - `Production`: `https://https://library-api-7pn2.onrender.com`
  
### Step 3: Using Variables in Requests
- In your Postman requests, replace the hardcoded URLs with the dynamic `{{baseUrl}}` variable.

2. Import the collection: 
   - Download the collection from this repository.
   - Open Postman and click `Import` in the top left corner.
   - Select the downloaded collection file.
3. Set up environments for `Development` and `Production`.
4. Switch between environments to test the API on localhost or on Render.
